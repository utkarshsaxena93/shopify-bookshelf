        Shopify Bookbar is a platform exclusively for Shopifolks to find and recommend books available in the Ottawa office.
        With reviews and recommendations from your peers, we want to help you choose the right book. We also want to save you the time and effort of physically browsing through
        the bookshelves spread across all 13?14? floors at Shopify.
        Shopify Bookbar was launched in September 2016.

      <p class="about__paragraph about__message">
        <strong>TLDR;</strong> First week at Shopify. So many books to choose from. Books books everywhere. Want to pick the best book to read. Don't want to waste
          time reading the "wrong" book. How do I decide what to read? Why not create a Rails app. coz that's how we roll at Shopify.
