    <h2>A Message From the creator of Shopify Bookshelf</h2>
    <p class="about__paragraph about__message">
      I (seriously) started  reading books after my 3rd year at <a href="www.ubc.ca" target="_blank">UBC</a>.
      Ever since, I've loved to read - usually books to improve myself personally and professionally.
      <br /><br />
      During my first interview with Lauren Cauchy, we talked about the books we read.
      I was told about the internal bookshelves spread across the office and the freedom to
      purchase books I needed.
      <br /><br />
      Fast forward a month, I had spent a considerable time familiarizing myself with Ruby on Rails to prepare myself for the upcoming internship at Shopify.
      I was looking for a project to put my skills to practice.
      So I decided to build a website â€“ a place where I could see what my fellow Shopifolks are reading, learn about what they thought of the books they read and how it helped them with their growth.
      <br /><br />
      Shopify Bookshelf is that platform. It is a place where you can see what your friends are reading and vice versa. You can organize what you've read or want to read.
      This is the place where you can find your next favorite book or explore new genres based on what your colleagues are reading.
